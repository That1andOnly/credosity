      <h2>What “life hit” usually looks like</h2>
      <p>
        Job loss. Medical bills. A divorce. Housing disruption. Caregiving. A month that became a year.
        None of that makes you irresponsible. It makes you human. Credit just records the impact like a
        blunt instrument.

          <h3>Step 1: Get the facts</h3>
          <p>
            Before you “fix” anything, know what’s actually on your reports. Not vibes, not fear, not guesses.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            Goal: identify late payments, collections, utilization, and errors.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Step 2: Stop the bleeding</h3>
          <p>
            Missed payments and high utilization do the most damage, fastest. Stabilize the basics first.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            Goal: autopay minimums where possible, reduce utilization, avoid new hard pulls unless necessary.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Step 3: Build forward</h3>
          <p>
            You rebuild credit by stacking boring wins: on-time history, controlled usage, and time.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            Goal: a plan you can keep for 90 days without white-knuckling it.

        <li>Prioritize on-time payment history. It’s the spine.</li>

        This site will recommend tools over time. If a tool is risky, we’ll say it. If it doesn’t fit your situation,
        we’ll say that too.
