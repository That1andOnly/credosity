      <p>
        The most common mistake after a denial is rapid-fire applications.
        That adds hard inquiries and can lower your odds for the next attempt.
        Slow down long enough to get the facts.

          <h3>Move 1: Get the reason code</h3>
          <p>
            Lenders usually provide a denial reason (often called an “adverse action” notice).
            It tells you what tripped the filter: score range, utilization, late payments, thin file, income mismatch, etc.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            Your goal: name the problem in one sentence. No guesses.

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Move 2: Check the basics that move the needle</h3>
          <p>
            Most denials come down to a few repeat offenders. Start here:
          </p>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li><strong>Utilization:</strong> high balances compared to limits.</li>
            <li><strong>Recent late payments:</strong> especially in the last 12 months.</li>
            <li><strong>Collections/charge-offs:</strong> unresolved or newly reported.</li>
            <li><strong>Thin file:</strong> not enough history or active accounts.</li>
            <li><strong>Too many inquiries:</strong> recent hard pulls.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="muted">
            You’re not fixing everything today. You’re identifying what matters most.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Move 3: Choose one rebuild action for the next 30 days</h3>
          <p>
            Pick the single action that improves your odds without creating new damage.
            Keep it boring. Keep it repeatable.
          </p>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li>If utilization is high: pay down balances strategically and keep them down.</li>
            <li>If you’re thin-file: consider credit-building tools (secured card, builder account).</li>
            <li>If errors exist: document and dispute with specifics, not emotion.</li>
            <li>If late payments are recent: stabilize payments first before applying again.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section callout">
      <h2>When you should NOT apply again yet</h2>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>If you don’t know why you were denied.</li>
        <li>If you have multiple recent hard pulls.</li>
        <li>If utilization is still high and you can’t keep it down.</li>
        <li>If you’re still missing payments.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Waiting can be the highest-IQ move. Denial hurts less than digging deeper.
